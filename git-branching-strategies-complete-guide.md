## What is Branching Strategy?

A **branching strategy** is a set of rules and conventions that teams follow to organize their Git workflow. It defines:

- How branches are created, named, and merged
- Which branches represent different environments (dev, staging, production)
- How features, hotfixes, and releases are managed
- Code review and deployment processes

### Why Branching Strategy Matters

- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers work simultaneously
- **Release Management**: Control what goes to production and when
- **Risk Mitigation**: Isolate unstable code from stable releases
- **Collaboration**: Clear workflow for team coordination
- **Deployment Control**: Automated CI/CD pipeline integration

## Popular Branching Strategies

### 1. Git Flow

**Best For**: Traditional software with scheduled releases, monolithic applications

**Structure**:
```
main (production)
├── develop (integration)
├── feature/user-authentication
├── feature/payment-gateway
├── release/v1.2.0
└── hotfix/critical-security-patch
```

**Branches**:
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature development
- `release/*`: Release preparation
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

**Workflow Example**:
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add user login functionality"
git push origin feature/user-authentication

# Create pull request to develop
# After review and merge, delete feature branch

# Create release branch
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
# Bug fixes and final testing
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.2.0
git tag v1.2.0

# Hotfix
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch
# Fix and test
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/security-patch
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/security-patch
```

### 2. GitHub Flow

**Best For**: Continuous deployment, web applications, microservices

**Structure**:
```
main (production)
├── feature/add-shopping-cart
├── feature/improve-search
└── hotfix/fix-payment-bug
```

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/add-shopping-cart

# Develop and push regularly
git add .
git commit -m "Implement cart functionality"
git push origin feature/add-shopping-cart

# Create pull request to main
# Deploy to staging for testing
# After approval, merge to main
# Automatic deployment to production
```

### 3. GitLab Flow

**Best For**: Applications with multiple environments, staged deployments

**Structure**:
```
main (development)
├── pre-production
├── production
├── feature/new-dashboard
└── feature/api-optimization
```

**Environment Branches**:
```bash
# Feature development
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/new-dashboard

# Merge to main after review
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-dashboard

# Deploy to staging
git checkout pre-production
git merge main

# Deploy to production
git checkout production
git merge pre-production
```

### 4. Trunk-Based Development

**Best For**: High-frequency deployments, mature CI/CD, experienced teams

**Structure**:
```
main (trunk)
├── short-lived-feature-1 (< 2 days)
└── short-lived-feature-2 (< 2 days)
```

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Very short-lived branches
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b quick-fix-123

# Small changes only
git add .
git commit -m "Fix button alignment"
git push origin quick-fix-123

# Immediate merge after quick review
# Feature flags for incomplete features
```

---

## Microservices vs Monolithic Applications

### Monolithic Application Strategy

**Recommended**: Git Flow or GitLab Flow

**Example**: E-commerce Platform (Single Repository)
```
ecommerce-platform/
├── src/
│   ├── user-service/
│   ├── product-service/
│   ├── order-service/
│   └── payment-service/
├── tests/
├── docs/
└── deployment/
```

**Branching Structure**:
```bash
# Git Flow for monolithic e-commerce
main                    # Production releases
├── develop            # Integration branch
├── feature/checkout-v2    # New checkout process
├── feature/mobile-app     # Mobile application
├── release/v2.1.0        # Release preparation
└── hotfix/payment-bug    # Critical payment fix
```

**Workflow Example**:
```bash
# New feature: Enhanced product search
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/enhanced-search

# Implement across multiple modules
# user-service: search preferences
# product-service: search algorithm
# frontend: search UI

git add .
git commit -m "Implement enhanced search across all modules"
git push origin feature/enhanced-search

# Create PR to develop
# Integration testing of entire application
# Merge after approval
```

### Microservices Application Strategy

**Recommended**: GitHub Flow or Trunk-Based Development

**Example**: E-commerce Microservices (Multiple Repositories)
```
user-service/           # Independent repository
├── main
├── feature/oauth-integration
└── hotfix/session-bug

product-service/        # Independent repository  
├── main
├── feature/elasticsearch
└── feature/recommendations

order-service/          # Independent repository
├── main
├── feature/async-processing
└── hotfix/inventory-sync
```

**Per-Service Workflow**:
```bash
# User Service - OAuth integration
cd user-service
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/oauth-integration

# Independent development and testing
git add .
git commit -m "Add OAuth 2.0 integration"
git push origin feature/oauth-integration

# Service-specific CI/CD pipeline
# Independent deployment
# Merge to main after testing
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Netflix (Microservices + GitHub Flow)

**Application**: Video Streaming Platform
**Architecture**: 700+ microservices
**Strategy**: GitHub Flow with service-specific repositories

```bash
# Video Encoding Service
video-encoding-service/
├── main (production)
├── feature/h265-support
├── feature/4k-optimization
└── hotfix/memory-leak

# Recommendation Service  
recommendation-service/
├── main (production)
├── feature/ml-model-v3
├── feature/real-time-updates
└── hotfix/cache-invalidation
```

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Independent service development
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/h265-support

# Service-specific testing and deployment
# No coordination with other services required
# Continuous deployment to production

# Result: 1000+ deployments per day
```

### Example 2: Shopify (Monolithic + Git Flow)

**Application**: E-commerce Platform
**Architecture**: Large monolithic Rails application
**Strategy**: Modified Git Flow

```bash
shopify-core/
├── main (production)
├── develop (integration)
├── feature/new-checkout
├── feature/multi-currency
├── release/2024-spring
└── hotfix/tax-calculation
```

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Coordinated feature development
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/new-checkout

# Cross-team collaboration required
# Comprehensive integration testing
# Scheduled releases every 2 weeks

# Result: Stable, coordinated releases
```

### Example 3: Spotify (Hybrid Approach)

**Application**: Music Streaming Platform
**Architecture**: Microservices with some shared components
**Strategy**: GitHub Flow for services, Git Flow for shared libraries

```bash
# Microservice (GitHub Flow)
playlist-service/
├── main
└── feature/collaborative-playlists

# Shared Library (Git Flow)
spotify-common-lib/
├── main
├── develop
├── feature/new-auth-module
└── release/v3.2.0
```

## Implementation Guides

### Setting Up Git Flow

```bash
# Install git-flow extension
brew install git-flow-avh  # macOS
# or
apt-get install git-flow   # Ubuntu

# Initialize git-flow in repository
git flow init

# Start new feature
git flow feature start user-authentication

# Finish feature (merges to develop)
git flow feature finish user-authentication

# Start release
git flow release start v1.2.0

# Finish release (merges to main and develop, creates tag)
git flow release finish v1.2.0

# Start hotfix
git flow hotfix start critical-bug

# Finish hotfix (merges to main and develop)
git flow hotfix finish critical-bug
```

### GitHub Flow Implementation

```bash
# Branch naming conventions
feature/add-user-profiles
bugfix/fix-login-error
hotfix/security-patch
improvement/optimize-database

# Workflow automation with GitHub Actions
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      
  deploy:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

        run: npm run test:coverage
        
      - name: Security scan
        run: npm audit
        
      - name: Check test coverage
        run: |
          COVERAGE=$(npm run test:coverage | grep "All files" | awk '{print $10}' | sed 's/%//')
          if [ $COVERAGE -lt 80 ]; then
            echo "Test coverage is below 80%"
            exit 1
          fi
```

### 5. Environment-Specific Deployment

```bash
