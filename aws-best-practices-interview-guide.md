# AWS Best Practices - Interview Guide

## 1. Security Best Practices

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum permissions needed
- **Use IAM Roles** instead of access keys for EC2 instances
- **Enable MFA** for all users, especially privileged accounts
- **Rotate credentials regularly**
- **Use IAM policies** with specific conditions and resource ARNs
- **Avoid root account** for daily operations

### Data Protection
- **Encrypt data at rest** using KMS or service-specific encryption
- **Encrypt data in transit** using SSL/TLS
- **Use VPC** for network isolation
- **Implement Security Groups** as virtual firewalls
- **Use NACLs** for subnet-level security
- **Enable CloudTrail** for audit logging

## 2. Cost Optimization

### Resource Management
- **Right-sizing**: Match instance types to workload requirements
- **Reserved Instances**: For predictable workloads (1-3 years)
- **Spot Instances**: For fault-tolerant, flexible workloads
- **Auto Scaling**: Scale resources based on demand
- **Lifecycle policies**: Transition S3 objects to cheaper storage classes

### Monitoring and Alerts
- **CloudWatch billing alerts**
- **AWS Cost Explorer** for cost analysis
- **AWS Budgets** for spending limits
- **Trusted Advisor** for cost recommendations

## 3. Reliability and Availability

### Multi-AZ and Multi-Region
- **Deploy across multiple AZs** for high availability
- **Use multiple regions** for disaster recovery
- **RDS Multi-AZ** for database failover
- **ELB health checks** for automatic failover

### Backup and Recovery
- **Automated backups** for RDS and EBS
- **Cross-region replication** for S3
- **AMI snapshots** for EC2 recovery
- **Define RTO and RPO** requirements

## 4. Performance Optimization

### Compute
- **Choose appropriate instance types** (compute, memory, storage optimized)
- **Use placement groups** for low-latency applications
- **Implement caching** with ElastiCache or CloudFront
- **Auto Scaling policies** based on metrics

### Storage
- **EBS volume types**: gp3 for general purpose, io2 for high IOPS
- **S3 storage classes**: Standard, IA, Glacier based on access patterns
- **Use CloudFront CDN** for global content delivery

## 5. Operational Excellence

### Monitoring and Logging
- **CloudWatch metrics** for resource monitoring
- **CloudWatch Logs** for application logging
- **X-Ray** for distributed tracing
- **AWS Config** for configuration compliance

### Automation
- **Infrastructure as Code** (CloudFormation, CDK, Terraform)
- **CI/CD pipelines** with CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy
- **Lambda** for serverless automation
- **Systems Manager** for patch management

## 6. Well-Architected Framework Pillars

- Enable traceability
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest

### Reliability
- Automatically recover from failure
- Test recovery procedures
- Scale horizontally for resilience
- Stop guessing capacity
- Manage change through automation

### Performance Efficiency
- Democratize advanced technologies
- Go global in minutes
- Use serverless architectures
- Experiment more often
- Consider mechanical sympathy

### Cost Optimization
- Implement cloud financial management
- Adopt consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending on undifferentiated heavy lifting
- Analyze and attribute expenditure
