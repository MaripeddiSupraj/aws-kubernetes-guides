## Zero-Downtime Principles and Patterns

### Application Resilience Patterns

#### Designing for Upgrade Resilience

**Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)**:
```
Why PDBs Are Critical:
- Prevent simultaneous pod eviction
- Ensure minimum availability during upgrades
- Coordinate with cluster autoscaler
- Protect against cascading failures

PDB Configuration Strategy:
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: web-app-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2  # or maxUnavailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app

Business Impact:
- Guaranteed service availability during upgrades
- Controlled disruption management
- Reduced customer impact
- Predictable upgrade behavior
```

**Health Checks and Readiness Probes**:
```
Comprehensive Health Check Strategy:

Liveness Probes:
- Detect application deadlocks
- Restart unhealthy containers
- Prevent zombie processes
- Maintain service quality

Readiness Probes:
- Control traffic routing
- Prevent premature traffic
- Ensure application startup completion
- Coordinate with load balancers

Startup Probes:
- Handle slow-starting applications
- Prevent premature liveness failures
- Allow extended initialization time
- Support legacy application migration

Configuration Example:
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 5
  failureThreshold: 3

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
  timeoutSeconds: 3
  failureThreshold: 3
```

#### Resource Management for Upgrades

**Resource Requests and Limits**:
```
Why Proper Resource Management Matters:
- Ensures predictable scheduling during upgrades
- Prevents resource contention
- Enables accurate capacity planning
- Supports quality of service guarantees

Resource Configuration Strategy:
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"

Capacity Planning:
- Reserve 20-30% extra capacity for upgrades
- Account for pod startup resource spikes
- Consider temporary double-scheduling
- Plan for node replacement scenarios
```

**Anti-Affinity and Topology Spread**:
```
High Availability Scheduling:

Pod Anti-Affinity:
affinity:
  podAntiAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - labelSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: app
          operator: In
          values:
          - web-app
      topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname

Topology Spread Constraints:
topologySpreadConstraints:
- maxSkew: 1
  topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
  whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
  labelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app

Benefits:
- Prevents single points of failure
- Distributes load across nodes and zones
- Improves upgrade resilience
- Reduces blast radius of node failures
```

### Load Balancer and Traffic Management

#### Application Load Balancer Configuration

**Health Check Optimization**:
```
ALB Health Check Strategy:
- Health check path: /health (lightweight endpoint)
- Healthy threshold: 2 consecutive successes
- Unhealthy threshold: 3 consecutive failures
- Timeout: 5 seconds
- Interval: 30 seconds

During Upgrades:
- Pods marked unhealthy are removed from load balancer
- New pods added only after passing health checks
- Traffic gradually shifts to healthy pods
- Zero customer impact from pod replacement
```

**Connection Draining**:
```
Graceful Connection Handling:
- Deregistration delay: 300 seconds (configurable)
- Existing connections complete naturally
- New connections routed to healthy targets
- Prevents abrupt connection termination

Configuration:
Target Group Attributes:
- deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds: 300
- load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled: true
- stickiness.enabled: false (for stateless apps)
```

#### Service Mesh Integration

**Istio Traffic Management**:
```
Service Mesh Benefits During Upgrades:
- Fine-grained traffic routing
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Retry and timeout policies
- Observability and monitoring
- Security policy enforcement

Traffic Splitting Example:
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        canary:
          exact: "true"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: web-app
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: web-app
        subset: v1
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: web-app
        subset: v2
      weight: 10
```
